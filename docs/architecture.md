# System Architecture Specification â€” worksync-platform

## 1. Executive Architecture Summary
The **worksync-platform** system is designed following modern microservices / modular monolith best practices to ensure high scalability, loose coupling, deterministic fault isolation, and low latency.

## 2. Layered Architectural Decomposition

### 2.1 Presentation & Client Interface Layer
- **Client Tier:** Modern component-driven reactive interface with responsive layouts, accessible UI design tokens, and optimized bundle footprints.
- **State Management:** Predictable state slices with optimistic UI updates and local cache invalidation.

### 2.2 Ingress & Gateway Layer
- Centralized reverse proxy handling SSL termination, CORS pre-flights, request validation, IP throttling, and routing.
- Context injection for tenant identification, correlation IDs, and actor security claims.

### 2.3 Application & Business Logic Services
- **Domain Entities & Aggregates:** Decoupled business rules independent of storage implementation.
- **Service Orchestrators:** Command and Query separation (CQRS) for heavy read/write transactional operations.

### 2.4 Data & Persistence Infrastructure
- **Relational Storage:** ACID-compliant relational schemas with indexed foreign relations and automated migration versioning.
- **In-Memory Caching:** Redis caching layer with TTL expirations for hotspot query optimization.
- **Event Bus:** Async messaging queue for decoupled background jobs, emails, and auditing.

## 3. Non-Functional Security & Performance Requirements
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT / OAuth 2.0 with cryptographic signature verification and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Transport Security:** Strict TLS 1.3 encryption across all public interfaces and internal service meshes.
- **Observability:** Centralized structured logging, OpenTelemetry tracing, and health check probes (liveness/readiness).
